This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems, and
lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port projects
with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same code over and
over again on each project.

This package depends on "libmd", get it from https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/libraries/libbsd/?search=libbsd
